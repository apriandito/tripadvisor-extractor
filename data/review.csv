2023-10-28,RS,3,Oct 2023 • Couples,"Ok, part of the Labuan Bajo experience",0,"The waterfall itself requires a bit of a drive from Labuan Bajo. You need to pay for entry as well as for a local guide (our taxi driver hadn’t mentioned that these were not included before we agreed it with him, so we learned from this going forward to always check).Upon arriving, it is a 15 minute walk to the waterfall and before jumping into the water you need to cross an old bridge. There is a small stand selling noodles and drinks next to the water, but do note that there are no real changing rooms or toilet facilities near the waterfall. This waterfall is a bit off the beaten path and you need to swim up to it. I was personally nervous to jump into the water as it didn’t look that clear and there were plenty of flies and bugs floating about. The water wasn’t stagnant though, it was running. However this isn’t like well known waterfalls in Bali or Lombok, so a lot more off the beaten path - please just be prepared for that.",76,"London, UK"

Easy walk down and back, a bit steep but had the hand of the obligatory guide as well as my ojek driver. The bridge to cross was a reminder of Nepal, bit rickety. Coffee/noodle stall at the falls.

2023-03-15,Lisa M,5,Mar 2023 • Family,Great side trip for the family - really enjoyable,0,"Super side trip from Labuan Bajo. The hike in is about 30 min, a little slippery in some places but not too much. Jumping in the water at the falls was awesome and a lovely respite from the heat. The guides were really friendly. Paid Rp 50,000 for two adults, kids came in free. Tipped our guides extra because they were super nice and helped keep our kids safe at the edge of the falls. Great trip.",7,""
2023-01-21,Linda T,3,Jan 2023 • Friends,"5 minutes attraction, nothing special, small waterfall and canion with dirty water.",0,"Nothing special really. 5 minutes walk from parking. Small waterfall and canion at its feet. There are some other Waterfall on Flores, so consider if you want to Pay to See this one (50 th/entrance, 50 th a guide). Makes sense if you are nearby. If not-dont bother.",8,""
2022-06-18,AncaBdx,5,Jun 2022,Great time at Cunca Wulang Waterfall,0,"I went today at Cunca Wulang waterfall, and from all aspects this was a great experience.The waterfall is about 1h from Labuan Bajo, through a picturesque and with little traffic road where you can admire the lush landscapes of Florès. The way to the waterfall is decently indicated, however if you miss the traffic signs like I did the villagers will be very happy to indicate you the way. The road is overall in good state, with however some big holes here and there preventing to drive at a high speed (I was in scooter).At the entrance, I paid 50'000Rp for the entrance, and 50'000Rp for the guide. It's easy to find the waterfall as you only need to follow a path, however there are strong currents at some points and the guide is here to advise you where to swim and to jump from the cliff safely. I've heard that last year people have drowned when they swam too close from the waterfall, so the madatory guide is also there to prevent accidents.  My guide, Viktor, was really nice and helpfull, proposed to carry my bag and helped me to go through the most slippery passages.There is a 15-20 min easy walk to the waterfall, through de beautiful jungle, where even at the warmest time of the day the shade keeps the temparature at a decent level. Just be careful to the slippery path, as verything is wet. The swim in the waterfall is refresing, you can jump from cliffs up to 10 meters, and then take all the time you want to relax or drink a coffee at the tiny shop there.The only pity was that, even in this beautiful jungle, there is littering - not huge, but even 1 plastic bottle every 100m is too much in this beautiful environment. So, I definitely recommend the activity, for the beautiful scenery, the kind people I've met, the swim in the shady jungle.",4,"Lausanne, Switzerland"
2021-11-29,Helen S,4,Nov 2021,A wet and wild walk,0,"We visited when it was torrential rain so not blue water for swimming in.  However, it was a great adventure and the waterfall in full spate was something else!   Our guide was lovely too.   There are a lot of steps to encounter if you are challenged with fitness or mobility.",386,"Leyland, UK"
2020-10-26,Sol G,5,Oct 2020 • Family,Great day trip,1,"We rented a bike and headed out for a day trip, the ride was great and the water fall good for a few hours fun including rock jumping, swimming and relaxing. The road is good and the walk in takes 20 minutes, not for the faint hearted.",17,"Canggu, Indonesia"
2019-12-31,UncleTravellingRich,1,Dec 2019 • Family,Run down,1,"We were enticed by prospect of waterfalls and swimming in clear water, as break on journey across Flores. It was disappointing. It was raining the day we went so water was brown (possibly this would be better when dry). Also the set up quite run down - all buildings falling apart, path poorly maintained. Expensive - IDR400k for the family and can’t see the need for the mandatory guide.",149,"Sydney, Australia"
2019-12-04,Piotrek,1,Nov 2019 • Couples,Waterfool mafia and thieves,8,"We arrived to Warsove village by a motorbike. When we reached the village near the waterfall, we were asked to pay an entrance fee at the ticketing office (small building on the right hand side). We paid 210.000 IDR (for two foreigners) . The amount was high and suspicous to us. According to the ticketing office employee the price includes a local guide, who you have to follow to get to Cunca Wulang Waterfall. Path to the waterfall is so easy that you don’t need any guide. After 1 min of walk our guide told us that he has to go back because he forgot to take a key from his motorbike. He came back and walked with us to the waterfall. He was very nice all the time, offering to to take photos of us. After visiting the waterfall, when we came back to the motorbike I noticed we had a flat tire. Our guide told us that he can take our motorbike to a mechanic and be back within 1 hour (we couldn't take his motorbike and go with him). After 15-20 min he was back and told us: BIG DAMAGE! and showed a tube with 20 cm hole! We thought it was impossible, because when we left our motorbike everything was ok. His price for the new tube was 350.000 IDR!!! It was a shock for us and we started to argue that it is too much. He explained that it is because the tube is from Ruteng city etc. We wanted to go with him to the mechanic to discuss the price in person but suddenly it turned out that our guide's scooter did not want to start. All we had to do is to pay him 350.000 IDR so we paid and we drove away. After 10 min ride we stopped and asked local people what is the price for replacing a tube and they told us about 50.000 IDR and that we got cheated. We decided to go back to the village and find our guide (we had his photo) and confirm the price for replacing a tube (not showing them how much we paid). The people said 60.000 IDR. One guy drove with us to our guide's home. He was very suprised that we showed up. We started a discussion that he had lied to us with the price. After 15 min of arguing he said the price in the village is 100.000 IDR. After another 10 min when we were fed up with this situation we told him that we want our 250.000 IDR back. He said: not 250.000 IDR but 200.000 IDR because 50.000 IDR is for his service!!! Another 10 min discussion… it was getting dark so we took our 200.000 IDR and went away as fast as we could...being so much dissapointed. We told the story at our rental place. The owner took the broken tube and said: IT’S NOT MINE, YOU HAVE BEEN CHEATED! That means, that our “guide” made sabotage  on our motorbike and stole our money. Below I attach a photo of this man as a warning to use services of this person.",3,""
2019-10-23,Mark N,3,Oct 2019,Pleasant Way to Spend a Morning Before Flying Out,2,"Pleasant place to spend our last half day before flying out of Labuan Bajo, but overall a little underwhelming. The water, a lovely blue-green in most of the photos we had seen, was yellowish-brown, which our guide attributed to runoff from a light rain the day before. While deep enough in one spot to jump in, it was also very shallow for large stretches, and if there were spots for deeper dives, our guide never showed them to us.Rented a motorbike in Labuan Bajo for Rp 75K and bought Rp 25K in gas along the way, which was much cheaper than the fees we read people had paid to hire a car and driver (~Rp 600,000). The way to the waterfall is quite straightforward, and took about 1.5 hours each way. The last 4km after you turn off the main road is in very poor repair and would be unsafe after rain. At the ticket office, we paid Rp 210K for two people, which included a guide. Our guide, a young guy named John, led us, on his motorbike, another 500m to the trail head. He was polite and spoke some English, but raced ahead of us on both the drive to the trail head, and then on the 500m trail to the waterfall too. Where he was helpful was in showing us where the water was deep enough to jump in and in taking a few photos of us. It would have been great if he could have told us a little more about the area's flora, fauna, geology, local customs, history, or anything else like that, but I don't think he had been given any training.",36,"Beijing, China"

She wasn’t disappointed with the fantastic varieties of plants and flowers. Also had a surprise encounter with a local monkey scavenging for food. Depending on where you are staying in Bali, the travel time to and from the gardens can be lengthy. We left Seminyak at 9am and arrived at the gardens at 11am. This was by private car. It was a similar timeframe to return. If you are making the long trip up there, you should also visit the Lake.",44,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia"

2019-08-04,Eric K,5,Aug 2019 • Couples,Don't miss it !!!,0,"After seeing the market, lake and temple we were debating the botanic gardens and could have said no, we are very happy we ended up going. This is a green oasis, a beautiful garden with lots of collection of tropical or other flower or plant varieties with some that are unexpected. We went for a long walk on our own and then decided we would not see most of the attractions (it's a very large park), so we went back to the entrance and then saw the buggies. If you get 5 people going they only pay 20K each, as it was only 2 of us we paid 100K but this was money well spent (for about 45 mins). Wayan our driver was charming and took us to the highlights and waited patiently for us. We took selfies with each other and had a great time. Bamboos, Begonias and the monkees were the standouts for us.",315,"Melbourne, Australia"
2019-08-03,Cait6,3,Aug 2019 • Friends,You don’t need to go right now,1,"Are you a local Balinese family looking for a tranquil green park to spend the day having a picnic? Go here. Are you a tourist who has a limited time in Ubud and could be doing more fun, adventurous activities? Don’t come here. It’s a 2 hour drive (minimum). The orchids aren’t in bloom right now, and the dreary cacti made me sad. The best part was a giant banyan tree, but my husband was unable to climb it. There was also this radical dragon face reptile building..it is locked and it appears that the reptiles have escaped. If you are still reading this, I for one welcome our new reptilian overlords.",25,"Toronto, Canada"
